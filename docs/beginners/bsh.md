# Getting Started

Welcome to the Professional Linux User Group! You’re likely here because you want to take a structured approach to learning Linux. Our community is passionate about sharing knowledge—we come together voluntarily to create these web-books as companion materials for our interactive courses.

We call them interactive because participation with your peers during the course time frame is required to earn a certificate. That said, you are also free to follow along with the materials at your own pace. Inside each book, you’ll find everything you need: labs, worksheets, and recorded lecture videos.

### A Bit About Linux

Linux, a **UNIX-like operating system**, is built around the **kernel**—the core component that acts as a bridge between hardware and software. The kernel manages resources such as memory, processes, and devices, while we as users interact with it indirectly through a **shell**, entering commands that the system interprets and executes.

On top of the Linux kernel sit many different **distributions (distros)**. A distribution is a curated package that typically includes:  
- The Linux kernel  
- A collection of software tools and utilities  
- Package management systems  
- Optionally, a desktop environment for graphical interaction  

These distributions vary in design and purpose—some focus on ease of use, others on performance, stability, or security. Whether you choose Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, or another distro, the underlying kernel remains the same, ensuring that once you learn Linux fundamentals, your skills are portable across nearly all versions.

## 1. Learning Basic Linux Skills

The best way to understand Linux is through hands-on practice. This is sometimes called Time on Tools (TOT)—the time you spend directly working with the commands, files, and systems yourself. Reading guides and watching tutorials are helpful, but it’s the act of typing commands, troubleshooting mistakes, and seeing the results that makes the knowledge stick.

### Killercoda

Killercoda is a website that hosts interactive labs developed by many different creators. Scott Champine (Het Tanis) has created a number of labs including the basics of Linux. By creating an account on `Killercoda` you will be able to gain hands on experience with the `Linux Command Line Terminal` through you web-browser on any computer free of charge.

### Joining the Discord

Our discord holds regular scheduled events where one can actively or passively participate. It is also a place to ask questions or get involved in projects.

## 2. Setting Up a Local Linux Install

Killercoda is a great way for newcomers to dip their toes into Linux. However, because Killercoda creates **ephemeral virtual environments**, everything is temporary—you can’t keep your progress or return to the same setup later. The next logical step is to set up something more **permanent**.

There are several ways you can run Linux at home:

- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Run Linux inside Windows or macOS using software like VirtualBox or VMware.  
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: A convenient way to run Linux alongside Windows without a full VM.  
- **HomeLab with a Hypervisor (e.g., Proxmox)**: Run multiple virtual machines or containers on one dedicated server.  
- **Direct Install**: Put Linux on an old desktop, laptop, or single-board computer (like a Raspberry Pi).  
- **Virtual Private Server (VPS)**: Rent a remote Linux server from a hosting provider.  

Each approach has pros and cons depending on your goals:

- Some setups include a **desktop environment**, while others are **headless** (no graphical interface, only command-line).  
- A dedicated hypervisor can host **multiple test environments**, while a direct install gives you a **single dedicated machine**.  

Take some time to research which option best fits your needs, budget, and comfort level.

## 3. Participation in a Course
the ProLUG Certified Enterprise Linux Administration Course is meant to teach you the fundamentals. It is a long and involved course at 16 weeks with
