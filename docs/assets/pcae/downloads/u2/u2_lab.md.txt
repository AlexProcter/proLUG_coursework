# Unit 2 Lab â€“ Interacting with the Operating System

This lab is designed to have the engineer verify and execute their automation tools to interact with the
OS in a controlled fashion.

If you do the Killercoda Lab 2, just answer these questions.  

If you are doing the lab in the ProLUG environment, find the scripts
in `/labs/automation/unit2`.

## Required Materials

- Putty or other connection too
- Lab Server (Killercoda recommended: https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/AutomationLabs/Unit2_Interacting_with_OS )
- Root or sudo command access

## Pre-Lab (Lab Setup) 
If you're not doing the lab on Killercoda, make sure to follow the setup guide
below.  

### ProLUG Lab Setup
If you're using the ProLUG lab environment, run the following commands.  
```bash
cd /root
cp -r /labs/automation/unit2/* /root
chmod 755 /root/*.sh
chmod 755 /root/*.py
```

### Personal Lab Setup
Alternatively, for your own lab environment, clone down the necessary files
from GitHub.  
```bash
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/het-tanis/prolug-labs.git
cp prolug-labs/AutomationLabs/Unit2_Interacting_with_OS/assets/* /root
```

## Lab ðŸ§ª

In this lab, we will go through the process of executing our automation tools.  

### Bash Execution

1. Run the `u2_script1.sh` and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   /root/u2_script1.sh
   ```
    - What are you shown?

2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first 15 lines.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script1.sh
   ```
    - Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.  


3. Run the u2_script2.sh and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   /root/u2_script2.sh
   ```
    - What happened in the script? Did it work correctly?
   ```bash
   ls -l /root
   ```


4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it use a different date format. You may have to read the
   man pages for date command.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script2.sh
   ```



As you're interacting with the OS, are there any observations you have about how the scripts are set up,
their structure and their output.   

- Is there anything you would add for your scripts?

- If you would add something, how does it improve the code?

### Python Execution

1. Run the u2_script1.py and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   /root/u2_script1.py
   ```
    - What are you shown?

2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first and last 15 lines.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script1.py
   ```
    - Note: Modify with `vi` or `vim`. You may have to RTFM to continue.  

3. Run the u2_script2.py and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   /root/u2_script2.py
   ```
    - What are you shown?


4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it use a different user shell, maybe one you've seen from
   other output in this lab.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script2.py
   ```
    - Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.

### Ansible Execution

1. Run the u2_script1.yml and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook /root/u2_script1.yml
   ```
    - What are you shown?

2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first and last 15 lines.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script1.yml
   ```
    - Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.  


3. Run the u2_script2.yml and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook /root/u2_script2.yml
   ```
    - What are you shown?

4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it name the file differently or populate different content.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script2.yml
   ```
    - Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.    

5. Do one final `ls -l` against the `/root` directory. What is a difference 
   between the `.sh`, `.py`, and `.yml` files?
   ```bash
   ls -l
   ```
