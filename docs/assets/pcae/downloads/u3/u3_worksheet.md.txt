Unit 3 Discussion Post 2: You are a system administrator for a small company with ~100
total Linux systems. The security engineer approaches you and shows you vulnerabilities in
your 110 total Linux systems. He then asserts, “without a good inventory, you cannot have
security in the system.”

1. Do you agree with him, why or why not?

   of just accepting the situation and allowing a system to keep running.
