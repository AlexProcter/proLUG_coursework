# Unit 10 - Recap and Final Project

## Overview

This final unit serves as a reflection point for the course, providing students the
opportunity to step back, assess what they've learned, and think deeply about how
these skills apply to real-world systems and career goals.

Unit 10 is less about introducing new tools or frameworks and more about
consolidating your knowledge into a cohesive security engineering mindset. Whether
through discussion posts, project finalization, or self-assessment, this unit is
designed to help you articulate your growth and prepare to present yourself as a
capable security professional.

## Learning Objectives

1. Reflect on key topics covered throughout the course and identify strengths and weaknesses.
2. Practice articulating technical security concepts and processes in your own words.
3. Prepare for technical interviews or resume reviews through self-explanation of security workflows.
4. Finalize and polish your capstone project deliverables.
5. Connect course topics to real industry expectations in security engineering.
