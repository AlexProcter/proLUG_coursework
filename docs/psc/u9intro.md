# Unit 9 - Certificate and key madness

## Overview

In today’s interconnected world, the integrity and security of transmitted data are paramount. As systems grow in complexity and interdependence, it’s crucial to verify the identity of those we communicate with and to protect the data in transit. Certificates and keys form the backbone of this trust. By securely exchanging and validating cryptographic keys and digital certificates, we establish a system where data can be encrypted, identities can be authenticated, and communications can be trusted.

## Learning Objectives

1. Define the purpose and function of digital certificates and cryptographic keys.
2. Understand the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
3. Learn how TLS uses certificates for secure communication.
4. Explore the process of certificate signing and validation (PKI).
5. Use tools like `openssl` to generate keys and inspect certificates.
