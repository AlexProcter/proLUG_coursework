# Unit 1 - Build Standards and Compliance

## Overview

Building standards and compliance in cybersecurity engineering ensures that
systems adhere to industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and
security frameworks, reducing risks and vulnerabilities.

By implementing structured guidelines through tools and frameworks like STIGs
(Security Technical Implementation Guides) and the NIST CS (National Institute
of Standards and Technology Cyber Security) framework, organizations can maintain
resilience against evolving threats while ensuring accountability and regulatory alignment.

This chapter will present critical knowledge in implementing security controls in
information systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Unit 1 students will have foundational knowledge and skills of
the concepts below:

1. Security Frameworks such as STIGs, CIS Controls, NIST Cybersecurity Framework
2. Regulatory Compliance and Industry Standards when administering and building systems
3. Skills and concepts in interacting with STIG remediation processes
4. Understanding Risk Management and concepts surrounding risk vectors to organizations
5. STIG Remediation and documentation skills
