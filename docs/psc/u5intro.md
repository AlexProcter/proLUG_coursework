# Repos & Patching

## Overview

Where software originates—and how and when it is updated (patched)—is essential to maintaining system stability and security. Every patch applied to a system must come from a known and trusted source, as introducing changes into a stable environment can have significant consequences. Administrators and engineers ensure that patching is planned and scheduled using verified, trackable repositories and resources.

In this unit, we will examine how this process is implemented in adjacent distributions, where administrators can apply granular control to Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) packages and maintain internal repositories of vetted packages.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the importance of package integrity.
2. Understand patching techniques and routines.
3. Understanding automated methods of patching.
