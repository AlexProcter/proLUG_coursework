# Unit 15 - Engineering Troubleshooting

## Overview

---

In this unit, we focus on **incident management, root cause analysis, and troubleshooting frameworks**. These are foundational skills for Linux administrators who are responsible for maintaining system reliability and responding effectively to issues.

You’ll explore structured approaches like the **Scientific Method**, **5 Whys**, **FMEA**, and **PDCA**, as well as methodologies like **Six Sigma**, **TQM**, and systems thinking. We’ll also look at tools for visual problem solving, including the **Fishbone Diagram** and **Fault Tree Analysis**, and discuss how data types play a role in investigations.

## Learning Objectives

---

**By the end of this unit, you will be able to**:

- Apply the **Scientific Method** to real-world troubleshooting scenarios
- Understand and use structured methods like **FMEA**, **5 Whys**, and **PDCA**
- Differentiate between **continuous and discrete data** in diagnostics
- Use visual tools like **Fishbone Diagrams** and **Fault Tree Analysis** to trace causes
- Explain the **OSI model** as it applies to layered troubleshooting
- Leverage concepts from **Six Sigma** and **5S methodology** to organize your workflows
- Document and communicate incidents effectively with post-mortem writeups
