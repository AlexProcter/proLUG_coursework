# Unit 10 - Kubernetes

## Overview

---

This unit introduces **Kubernetes (K8s)**, an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The unit covers:

- **Understanding Kubernetes Architecture** - Nodes, Control Plane, and Cluster Components.
- **Installing K3s** - A lightweight Kubernetes distribution optimized for resource efficiency.
- **Interacting with Kubernetes** - Using `kubectl` to manage and troubleshoot clusters.
- **Deploying Applications** - Creating and managing **Pods, Deployments, and Services**.
- **Security and Best Practices** - Implementing security measures and troubleshooting issues.

Kubernetes plays a critical role in **modern enterprise infrastructure**, enabling **scalability, high availability, and automation** in cloud-native applications.
