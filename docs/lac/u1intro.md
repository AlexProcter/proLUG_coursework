# Unit 1 - Linux File Operations

## Overview

---

This unit introduces the foundational skills needed for effective Linux system administration with an emphasis on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It covers:

- **Command-Line Proficiency:** Mastery of the shell environment is essential for routine tasks such as navigating the file system, managing processes, and automating scripts.
- **Text Editing with VI/Vim:** Given that many RHEL systems use VI/Vim as the default editor for configuration and scripting, learners are introduced to these tools through practical exercises like using vimtutor and exploring interactive resources (e.g., VIM Adventures).
- **Understanding the Linux File System:** The worksheet emphasizes the standard Linux file hierarchyâ€”critical for managing files, permissions, and services in a Red Hat environment.
- **Basic Utilities and System Management:** Along with the command-line and text editors, the unit touches on fundamental utilities that are pivotal for system configuration, troubleshooting, and maintenance on enterprise systems.

## Learning Objectives

---

1. **Master Command-Line Fundamentals:**
    - Develop proficiency in navigating the Linux command-line interface (CLI) for everyday system management tasks.
    - Learn how to execute commands to manipulate files, directories, and system processes efficiently.
2. **Understand the Linux File System:**
    - Grasp the structure and organization of the Linux file hierarchy.
    - Comprehend how the file system affects system configuration, security, and troubleshooting on Red Hat platforms.
3. **Gain Proficiency in Text Editing with VI/Vim:**
    - Acquire hands-on experience with vi/vim through guided exercises (e.g., vimtutor, VIM Adventures).
    - Learn to edit configuration files and scripts accurately, which is critical for system administration.

4. **Engage with Practical System Administration Tasks:**
    - Explore foundational utilities and commands essential for managing a Linux system.
    - Apply theoretical knowledge through real-world examples, discussion posts, and interactive resources to reinforce learning.

These objectives are designed to ensure that learners not only acquire technical competencies but also understand how these skills integrate into broader system administration practices in a Red Hat environment.
