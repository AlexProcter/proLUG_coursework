# Unit 9 - Containerization on Linux

## Overview

---

In this unit, we dive into the modern world of containerization, focusing on **Podman**—an open-source, daemon-less container engine. As Linux administrators, understanding containerization is crucial for supporting developers, managing production systems, and deploying services efficiently.

We’ll explore what containers are, how to manage them, and how to build container images.

## Relevance & Context

Containerization is a critical part of modern IT, powering development pipelines **(CI/CD)**, cloud deployments, and microservices. As Linux system administrators, we are expected to support and troubleshoot containers, manage container infrastructure, and ensure smooth operations across development and production environments.

This unit focuses on **Podman**, a secure, rootless, and daemon-less alternative to Docker, widely used in enterprise environments like Red Hat and Rocky Linux. Whether you work in a NOC, DevOps, or traditional SysAdmin role, understanding containerization is essential to being an effective part of any IT team.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Explain what containers are and how they fit into modern Linux system administration
- Run and manage Podman containers, including starting, stopping, and inspecting containers
- Build custom container images using Dockerfiles and Podman
- Analyze container processes, logs, and network interactions for troubleshooting
