# Unit 16 Lab - Incident Response

!!! info

    If you are unable to finish the lab in the ProLUG lab environment we ask you `reboot` the machine from the command line so that other students will have the intended environment.

The unit 16 lab will be done during the lecture. Students will troubleshoot problems
on systems in the ProLUG lab environment.


### Required Materials

- Rocky 9.4+ - ProLUG Lab
    - Or comparable Linux box
- root or sudo command access

## LAB

You have the answers here, if they ask, you may give them hints. Otherwise, you can help them find the
right solution any way you want to.

### Scenario 1

- Connect to `tshoot1@prolug.asuscomm.com`
- Password:

A ticket has come in that the web server is not running on the web server.

To complete this event the following three must be correct.

1. Web server must be running.

   - HINT:
     ```bash linenums="1"
     systemctl status httpd
     ```

<!-- - Answer: -->
<!--   ```bash linenums="1" -->
<!--   systemctl enable --now httpd # or some variation of that must have been run -->
<!--   ``` -->

2. Web server must respond on port 80.

   - HINT: Can you check the open ports?

<!-- - Answer: -->
<!--   ```bash linenums="1" -->
<!--   ss -ntulp  # Will show port 80 -->
<!--   ``` -->
<!-- The server is currently set on `8087` and needs to be fixed in `/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf`. -->
<!-- The "Listen 8087" line must be changed to "Listen 80" and the service restarted `systemctl restart httpd`. -->

3. Ensure that the server can be reached by external connection attempts on port 80.

   - HINT: Is the firewall running?
     ```bash linenums="1"
     systemctl status firewalld
     ```

<!-- - Answer: Easiest is to turn off the firewall. -->
<!--   ```bash linenums="1" -->
<!--   systemctl stop firewalld. -->
<!--   ``` -->
<!--   - If they want to open the port, they can do that too. -->

<b>Reboot the lab machine when finished.</b>
</div>

### Scenario 2

- Connect to `tshoot2@prolug.asuscomm.com`
- Password:

A ticket has come in that a mount point, `/space`, is not working correctly. The team expected a
9GB partition to be built there on the 3 attached disks, but found that it was not a separate
partition.

Verify that `/space` is not set up correctly.

- HINT: You may want to revisit lab 3 of the course for this one. This is a challenge here.

To complete this event the following four must be correct.

1. The three disks must be properly set up in LVM.

   - HINT: use `mkfs` to make a filesystem.

<!-- - Answer: -->
<!--   - First identify all disks: `fdisk -l | grep -i xvd`. Then `pvcreate /dev/xvd<whatever>`. -->
<!--   - Then `vgcreate space /dev/xvd<disk1> /dev/xvd<disk2> /dev/xvd<disk3>`. -->
<!--   - Then `lvcreate -n space -l +100%FREE space_vg` -->

2. EXT4 or XFS must be installed on the logical volume.

   - HINT: Use your `pvs`, `vgs`, `lvs` tools

<!-- - Answer: -->
<!--   ```bash linenums="1" -->
<!--   mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/<name of logical volume> -->
<!--   ``` -->

3. `/space` must be created and mounted off on this filesystem.

   - Hint: Make the directory

<!-- - Answer: -->
<!--   ```bash linenums="1" -->
<!--   mkdir /space -->
<!--   vi /etc/fstab -->
<!--   ``` -->
<!--   Add an entry like this: -->
<!--   ```plaintxt -->
<!--   /dev/mapper/<name of logical volume> /space <NFS or XFS> defaults 1 2 -->
<!--   ``` -->

4. `/etc/fstab` or `systemd` must have an entry for `/space` (do not reboot during
   the lab, as this will not work).

Same way as above.

### Scenario 3

- Connect to `tshoot3@prolug.asuscomm.com`
- Password:

Your team is trying to update your servers during a maintenance window. Your junior
administrator kicks you over a server that they cannot get to update.

To complete this event the following two must be correct.

1. Fix the system to be able to update via `dnf`.

   - HINT: DNF isnâ€™t updating, so where are the repos that it looks for?

<!-- - Answer: -->
<!--   ```bash linenums="1" -->
<!--   vi /etc/yum.repos.d/rocky.repo -->
<!--   ``` -->
<!--   Look for `enabled=0`. This needs to be changed back to `1`. -->
<!--     * If you need a reference, the original is over in `/etc/yum.repos.d/rocky.repo.orig`. -->
<!--       The EPEL repo is busted the same way, as it needs to be enabled. -->

2. Verify that kernel updates are happening.

   - HINT: Where can updates be excluded in DNF or Yum?

<!-- - Answer: You need to comment out the line in `/etc/yum.conf` about `"exclude=kernel*"` because -->
<!--   this is stopping any kernel updates from happening. -->

!!! info

    Be sure to `reboot` the lab machine from the command line when you are done.
