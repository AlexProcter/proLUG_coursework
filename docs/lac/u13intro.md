# Unit 13 - System Hardening

## Overview

---

In this unit, we focus on **system hardening** — the process of configuring Linux systems to meet defined security standards. As threats evolve, system administrators play a key role in ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability by reducing attack surfaces and enforcing secure configurations.

We will explore industry benchmarks like **STIGs and CIS**, implement hardening techniques for services like SSH, identify unneeded software, and analyze system security posture using tools like the **SCC Tool**. You’ll also revisit baselining and documentation as part of security validation and compliance.

## Learning Objectives

---

**By the end of this unit, you will be able to**:

- Define system hardening and understand its role in securing Linux servers
- Scan systems using the **SCC Tool** to assess security compliance
- Apply remediation steps based on **STIG** reports
- Harden services such as **SSHD**, remove unnecessary software, and lock down ports
- Rescan and verify improvements in your system’s security posture
- Understand the importance of documentation and change management in security
