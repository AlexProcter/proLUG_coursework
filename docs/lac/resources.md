# Resources

This file is dynamically generated at build time using GitHub Actions.  

To see what it looks like after build, run `./scripts/generate-resources` from 
the **root directory** of the project:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/course-books.git
cd course-books
./scripts/generate-resources
```
