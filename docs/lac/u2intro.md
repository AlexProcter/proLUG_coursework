# Unit 2 - Essential Tools

## Overview

---

This unit centers on a focus on security and troubleshooting.

- The use of **SELinux** for implementing mandatory access controls, managing file permissions with **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**,
- Understanding operational methodologies for incident triage.

## Learning Objectives

---

1. **Understand and Configure SELinux:**
    - Grasp the core concepts of SELinux, including security contexts, labels, and its role in enforcing mandatory access control.
    - Learn how to configure and troubleshoot SELinux settings to ensure system security and compliance.

2. **Master Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
    - Recognize the limitations of traditional Unix permissions and how ACLs provide granular control over file and directory access.
    - Develop skills in applying and managing ACLs in a complex Linux environment.

3. **Develop Effective Troubleshooting Methodologies:**
    - Acquire techniques to diagnose and resolve system access issues, particularly those arising from SELinux policies and ACL misconfigurations.
    - Apply structured troubleshooting strategies to ensure minimal downtime and maintain high availability.

4. **Integrate Theoretical Knowledge with Practical Application:**
    - Engage with interactive exercises, discussion prompts, and real-world scenarios to reinforce learning.
    - Utilize external resources, such as technical documentation and instructional videos, to supplement hands-on practice.

5. **Enhance Collaborative Problem-Solving Skills:**
    - Participate in peer discussions and reflective exercises to compare different approaches to system administration challenges.
    - Learn to articulate and document troubleshooting processes and system configurations for continuous improvement.

6. **Build a Foundation for Advanced Security Practices:**
    -  Understand how SELinux and ACLs fit into the broader context of system security and operational stability.
    -  Prepare for more advanced topics by reinforcing the fundamental skills needed to manage and secure RedÂ Hat Enterprise Linux environments.

These objectives aim to ensure that learners not only acquire specific technical skills but also develop a holistic understanding of how to secure and manage Linux systems in enterprise settings.
