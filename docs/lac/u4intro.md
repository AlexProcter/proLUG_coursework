# Unit 4 - Operating Running Systems

## Overview

---

This unit concentrates on the core tasks involved in **operating running systems** in a Linux environment, particularly with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It covers:
    - Understanding resource usage CPU, memory, disk I/O.
    - Become familiar with service management frameworks.

## Learning Objectives

---

1. **Monitor and Manage System Resources:**
    - Learn to track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
    - Understand how to troubleshoot performance bottlenecks.

2. **Master Service and Process Control:**
    - Gain proficiency with systemd for managing services and understanding dependency trees.
    - Acquire the ability to identify, start, stop, and restart services and processes as needed.

3. **Configure and Interpret System Logs:**
    - Explore journald and syslog-based logging to collect and store vital system events.
    - Develop techniques to analyze log files for troubleshooting and security assessments.

4. **Implement Scheduling and Automation:**  
    - Use `cron`, `at`, and `systemd` timers to automate recurring tasks.
   Understand how automated job scheduling improves reliability and reduces manual intervention.

These objectives ensure learners can sustain, troubleshoot, and improve actively running Linux systems
within enterprise environments, reducing downtime and increasing system reliability.
