#### Discussion Post #1

Find a blog post or open source tool that focuses on IT inventory management.  

1. What is meant by the term “inventory” in an IT context?
2. What are some of the issues with inventories in a company?
    - How have people attempted to overcome these issues?
3. What different formats of inventories can you find for IT management?
    - Why would formatting matter?


#### Discussion Post #2

You are a system administrator for a small company with ~100 total Linux 
systems. The security engineer approaches you and shows you vulnerabilities in 
your 110 total Linux systems. He then asserts, "without a good inventory, you 
cannot have security in the system."  

1. Do you agree with him, why or why not?

    1. How do you plan to start to “true up” your inventories?

    2. How can you prevent this type of problem (if you think it is one) in the future?

2. We often say in engineering, “Or you can do nothing”. This speaks to the possibility
   of just accepting the situation and allowing a system to keep running.

    1. Can you do that in this situation, or must this be corrected? Why or why not?

## Digging Deeper

1. Build some inventories like the ones here:
   <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html>

    1. Parse these down using ansible-inventory to see if you understand the syntax
       and formatting.

    2. Run through this lab for understanding:
