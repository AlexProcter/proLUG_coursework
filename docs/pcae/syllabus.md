### Course Description

This course addresses how to automate Linux in a corporate environment. This course will focus on
taking design, build, deploy, administration, and remediation tasks and turning them into automated
processes. The emphasis will be on integration during the build, run, and end of life phase so that CI/CD
can occur and deployments as code are utilized. The learner will practice securely building, deploying,
integrating, and monitoring Linux systems in an automated fashion.

### Prerequisite(s) and/or Corequisite(s):

Prerequisites: None  
Credit hours: N/A  
Contact hours: 160 (60 Theory Hours, 100 Lab Hours)

## Course Plan

### Instructional Methods

This course is designed to promote learner-centered activities and support the development of Linux
automation skills. The course utilizes individual and group learning activities, performance-driven
assignments, problem-based cases, projects, and discussions. These methods focus on building
engaging learning experiences conducive to development of critical knowledge and skills that can be
effectively applied in professional contexts.

The "**Explore :octicons-arrow-right-24: Practice :octicons-arrow-right-24: Apply**" acquisition
path will be integrated into this course.

### Class size

This class will effectively engage 100-200 learners.

### Class Schedule

Class will meet over weekend (brown bag) sessions. One (1) time per week, for 16 weeks.
There will be a total of 16 sessions.

## Suggested Learning Approach

In this course, you will be studying individually and within a group of your peers, primarily in a lab
environment. As you work on the course deliverables, you are encouraged to share ideas with your peers
and instructor, work collaboratively on projects and team assignments, raise critical questions, and
provide constructive feedback.
