# ProLUG Course Work

This is my personal completion of the ProLUG content graciously provided free of charge by Het_Tanis and his crack team of engineers.
More information about them is included below

# About ProLUG

## Goals

The overarching goal of this project is to provide free and open source educational course material predicated on the
work produced by Scott Champine, an experienced and skilled Senior Systems Engineer.

Scott has over 20+ years administering and engineering Linux systems across a broad variety of
fields and teams. He has built and maintains systems like High Performance Compute (HPC) clusters
for [NOAA (The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)](https://www.noaa.gov/) and more.

ProLUG looks forward to working with contributors who want to give back to the community and produce
skilled Systems Administrators and Systems enthusiasts.

## Objectives

Contributors will be tasked with developing templated course material provided by Scott Champine.
Outlined below are a set of objectives this repository attempts to provide.

- Provide a centralized set of worksheets and labs for prospective learners to begin understanding Systems Administration,
  Engineering, Security, and Automation.
- Deliver templated versions of course work per unit along with supplementary material and video.
- Provide learners with foundational knowledge in computer systems to include:
  - Linux fundamentals in Administration and Security:
    - Basic command line skills, ie. scripting, tools, syntax
    - Networking
    - Security practices
  - Systems engineering
    - Server build processes
    - System hardening
    - Construction of build testing, ie. conditional testing, system tasks
    - Introductions to technologies like:
      - Podman, Kubernetes, Ansible
    - Troubleshooting and system benchmarking
- Systems Automation and implementation

## ProLUG Course Books

This is a collection of all course books produced by the Professional Linux Users Group (ProLUG).

- [Prolug Course Books](https://professionallinuxusersgroup.github.io/course-books/)

Previously these were in separate repositories:

- [Linux Administration Course](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/lac)
- [Security Engineering Course](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/psc)
- [Automation Engineering Course](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/pcae)

We decided to consolidate these repositories into a monorepo for simplicity and make it easier for prospective contributors.
