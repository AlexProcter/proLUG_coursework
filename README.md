# ProLUG Course Books

This is a collection of all course books produced by the Professional Linux Users Group (ProLUG).

Previously these were in separate repositories:

- [Linux Administration Course](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/lac)
- [Security Engineering Course](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/psc)
- [Automation Engineering Course](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/pcae)

We decided to consolidate these repositories into a monorepo for simplicity and
make it easier for prospective contributors.
